BioinformHER-Module-1-Mini-Project

This project involves the comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the human TNF gene, which encodes the proinflammatory cytokine TNF. 
Use of various bioinformatics tools, databases like NCBI for downloading TNF gene sequence, translating it into an amino acid sequence, 
identify open reading frames (ORFs), analyze nucleotide composition, and search for functional motifs has been done. 
Additionally, the project includes predicting coding/non-coding regions, identifying transcription factor binding sites, and converting sequence file formats.
Each step reinforces bioinformatics skills through practical application, resulting in a detailed analysis and interpretation of the TNF gene.
